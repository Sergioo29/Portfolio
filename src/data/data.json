    "about": "A Brazilian with a major in Web Development, and minor in Graphic Design to better craft and build websites. Drawing is one of my favorite hobbies. Besides the HTML, CSS, and JS essential programming languages of web development, I also know how to write in Python and C++. I am a proactive learner and a good teacher. One example of that is that I learned how to speak English myself. I even started a free English class in my community, having almost 10 active students for 6 months before coming to Idaho. During COVID, I had a home-office internship at FamilySearch. I've created images, blog articles, translated videos, and live streamed for their social media. I also learned about Power BI there. I've created and weekly updated data models about all the FamilySearch Brazil Area reach using Power BI.",
